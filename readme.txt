== Recommended Usage ==

* Since Easy VBOX7 1.2 you are able to use the new shortcodes
* Enclosing shortcode - example: [vbox7]89af3669[/vbox7]
* Self-closing shortcode - example: [vbox7 id="89af3669" width="450" height="403" autoplay="1"]

* You can specify additional parameters (separated by ":") for custom width and height. The width and height must be integers between 10 and 999.
* The forth parameter with the constant value of 1 is the autoplay option. If you don't want it enabled, just skip it.
* The right syntax is: [play:video_id:width:height:1]
* The parameters width, height and autoplay are optional.
